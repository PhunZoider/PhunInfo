# PhunInfo

A ProjectZombiod mod for the PhunZoid server. 

# What does it do?

When a player joins, a popup containing server configurable news appears (eg for FAQs or news). It also contains tabs with player stats and such.

# To configure

In addition to the standard installation processes (subscribe via Steam workshop, add to your config), you will need a server side file that holds your news. That is found in the ServerFiles/Lua folder of this repo. Feel free to customise to suit your server.
